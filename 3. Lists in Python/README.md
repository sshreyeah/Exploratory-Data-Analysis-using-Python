**Title**

**Lists in Python: Indexing, Slicing, and List Methods**

## ****Aim****

To understand Python lists and perform operations such as indexing, slicing, and using built-in list methods.

## ****Objectives****

- To create and access lists
- To perform indexing and slicing operations
- To apply commonly used list methods
- To understand mutable nature of lists
- To perform list traversal and modification

**Theory**

**1\. Introduction to Lists**

A **list** is a built-in data structure in Python used to store **multiple values in a single variable**. Lists are written using **square brackets \[ \]** and elements are separated by commas.

Lists are one of the most widely used data structures in Python because they are **flexible and dynamic**.

**2\. Characteristics of Python Lists**

- **Ordered:** Elements maintain insertion order
- **Indexed:** Each element has a unique index starting from 0
- **Mutable:** Elements can be modified after creation
- **Heterogeneous:** Can store different data types in one list
- **Allows Duplicates:** Same value can appear multiple times

### ****List Creation****

Lists can be created in multiple ways:

- Using square brackets
- Using the list() constructor

Lists can also be **nested**, meaning a list can contain another list.

### ****4\. Indexing in Lists****

Indexing allows access to individual elements of a list.

#### **Types of Indexing**

- **Positive Indexing:** Starts from 0 (left to right)
- **Negative Indexing:** Starts from -1 (right to left)

| **Element** | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| Negative Index | \-4 | \-3 | \-2 | \-1 |

### ****5\. Slicing in Lists****

Slicing is used to extract a **portion (sublist)** from a list.

**General Syntax:**

list_name\[start : end : step\]

### Meaning of each part

- **start** → index to begin slicing (included)
- **end** → index to stop slicing (excluded)
- **step** → gap between elements (optional)

Types of slicing:

- Beginning slice
- Ending slice
- Full slice

Slicing does not modify the original list.

### ****6\. Mutability of Lists****

Lists are **mutable**, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.

Operations possible due to mutability:

- Updating elements
- Adding new elements
- Removing elements

This feature makes lists suitable for dynamic data storage.

### ****7\. List Traversal****

Traversal means accessing each element of the list one by one.

Traversal can be done using:

- for loop
- while loop

Traversal is commonly used for data processing and analysis.

### ****8\. List Methods****

Python provides several built-in methods to manipulate lists.

| **Method** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| append() | Adds element at the end |
| insert() | Inserts element at given index |
| remove() | Removes specified element |
| pop() | Removes element by index |
| sort() | Sorts list |
| reverse() | Reverses list |
| clear() | Removes all elements |
| count() | Counts occurrences |
| index() | Returns index of element |

### ****9\. Built-in Functions for Lists****

Python provides built-in functions to work with lists:

| **Function** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| len() | Number of elements |
| max() | Maximum value |
| min() | Minimum value |
| sum() | Sum of elements |

**1\. Student Marks Management System**

A teacher wants to store marks of students in a list.

**Tasks:**

- Create a list of student marks
- Display highest and lowest marks
- Calculate average marks
- Sort the marks in ascending order

**Concepts Used:** List creation, max(), min(), sum(), len(), sort()

**2\. Grocery Shopping List**

A user maintains a grocery list for monthly shopping.

**Tasks:**

- Create a grocery list
- Add new items to the list
- Remove purchased items
- Display the final shopping list

**Concepts Used:** append(), remove(), indexing

**3\. Attendance Register**

A class teacher records daily attendance.

**Tasks:**

- Store present student roll numbers in a list
- Check whether a particular student is present
- Count total students present

**Concepts Used:** in operator, count(), len()

**4\. Mobile Contact List**

A person stores phone contacts in a list.

**Tasks:**

- Create a list of contacts
- Add a new contact
- Delete an existing contact
- Display contacts alphabetically

**Concepts Used:** append(), remove(), sort()

**5\. Temperature Analysis**

Daily temperature readings of a city are stored in a list.

**Tasks:**

- Display temperatures of first and last 5 days
- Find highest and lowest temperature
- Calculate average temperature

**Concepts Used:** Slicing, max(), min(), sum()

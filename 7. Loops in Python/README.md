# **Experiment – 7**

## **Loops in Python**

## **Aim**

To study and implement looping statements in Python and understand repetition of statements using different loop constructs.


## **Objectives**

* To understand the concept of loops
* To implement `for` and `while` loops
* To use nested loops
* To apply loop control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
* To solve real-life programming problems using loops


## **Theory on Loops**

Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is satisfied. They help in reducing code repetition and making programs more efficient.

Python mainly provides two types of loops:

* `for` loop
* `while` loop

The `for` loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It works with sequences like lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a condition. It runs as long as the condition remains `True`.

Python also provides loop control statements such as:

* `break` → Terminates the loop
* `continue` → Skips the current iteration
* `pass` → Acts as a placeholder

Indentation plays an important role in defining the scope of loops.


## **Types of Loops**

* `for` loop
* `while` loop
* Nested loops
* Loop control statements


# Programs


## Program 1: Simple for Loop

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```


## Program 2: for Loop with List

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```


## Program 3: while Loop

```python
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```


## Program 4: Nested Loop (Right-Angled Triangle)

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end="")
    print()
```

## Program 5: Loop Control Statements

### Using break

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

### Using continue

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```


## **Applications of Loops**

* Printing patterns
* Iterating through lists and strings
* Calculating sums and averages
* Checking prime numbers
* Menu-driven programs
* Repetitive real-life tasks


## **Conclusion**

Loops are essential in Python programming as they allow repetitive execution of code efficiently. By using `for`, `while`, nested loops, and loop control statements, programmers can solve complex problems in a structured and simplified manner. Mastering loops is fundamental for developing logical and efficient programs.

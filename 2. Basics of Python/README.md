# Experiment–2  
## Python Environment, Data Types, Operators, and Basic I/O

### Aim
To understand the Python programming environment, execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations.

### Objectives
- Study Python environment and interfaces  
- Understand interactive and script execution modes  
- Learn comments in Python  
- Understand variables, identifiers, and data types  
- Learn different operators  
- Perform basic input and output operations  

### Theory

#### Python Environment & Execution Modes
Python programs can be executed using Python Shell, Jupyter Notebook, IDEs (PyCharm, VS Code), and Google Colab.

- **Interactive Mode:** Executes code line by line with immediate output  
- **Script Mode:** Executes a complete program saved in a `.py` file  

#### Comments
- Single-line comments use `#`  
- Multi-line comments use triple quotes `""" """`

#### Variables & Data Types
Python uses dynamic typing. Common data types include:
- `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`  
Use `type()` to identify the data type of a variable.

#### Operators
- **Arithmetic:** `+ - * / %`  
- **Relational:** `> < >= <= == !=`  
- **Logical:** `and`, `or`, `not`  
- **Assignment:** `= += -= *= /=`  
- **Bitwise:** `& | ^ << >>`  

#### Input & Output
- `input()` is used to take user input (string by default)  
- `print()` is used to display output and formatted results  

### Programs Included
- Demonstration of comments and execution modes  
- Variable declaration and data type identification  
- Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators  
- User input and formatted output  

### Conclusion
The Python environment, execution modes, comments, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations were successfully studied and implemented.

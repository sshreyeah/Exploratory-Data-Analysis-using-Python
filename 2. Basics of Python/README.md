**Title**

**Python Environment, Data Types, Operators, and Basic Input/Output**

**Aim**

To study the Python programming environment and interface, understand execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations in Python.

**Objectives**

- To understand the Python programming environment and interface
- To study Python execution modes
- To understand comments in Python
- To learn variables, identifier rules, and data types
- To study different operators and expressions
- To understand basic input and output mechanisms

**Theory**

**1\. Python Environment and Interface**

The Python environment provides tools and interfaces to write, execute, and debug Python programs. Python programs can be executed using different interfaces such as:

- Python Shell
- Jupyter Notebook
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Spyder, PyCharm, and VS Code
- Cloud-based platforms like Google Colab

The interface allows users to write code, execute instructions, and view results interactively.

**2\. Python Execution Modes**

Python supports two main execution modes:

**a) Interactive Mode**

- Commands are executed one line at a time
- Immediate output is displayed
- Useful for testing small code snippets and learning

Examples: Python shell, Jupyter Notebook cells, Google Colab

**b) Script Mode**

- Programs are written in a file and executed as a whole
- Suitable for developing complete applications
- Files usually have .py extension

**3\. Comments in Python**

Comments are non-executable statements used to explain code and improve readability.

- **Single-line comments:** Begin with #
- **Multi-line comments:** Written using triple quotes (""" """)

Comments help in documentation and understanding program logic.

**4\. Variables and Identifiers**

A variable is a named memory location used to store data values.

**Rules for Identifiers:**

- Must start with a letter (A-Z, a-z) or underscore _
- Cannot start with a digit
- Case-sensitive
- Should not use Python keywords

Python uses **dynamic typing**, meaning variables do not require explicit data type declaration.

**5\. Data Types in Python**

Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of data.

**Basic Data Types**

- **Integer (int)**: Whole numbers
- **Floating-point (float)**: Decimal numbers
- **String (str)**: Sequence of characters
- **Boolean (bool)**: True or False

The data type of a variable can be identified using the type() function.

**6\. Operators and Expressions**

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

**Types of Operators**

- **Arithmetic Operators:** Used for mathematical calculations  
    (+, -, \*, /, %)
- **Relational Operators:** Used for comparison  
    (>, &lt;, &gt;=, <=, ==, !=)
- **Logical Operators:** Used to combine conditions  
    (and, or, not)
- **Assignment Operators:** Used to assign values  
    (=, +=, -=, \*=, /=)
- **Bitwise Operators:** Perform operations at bit level  
    (&, |, ^, &lt;<, &gt;>)

An **expression** is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.

**7\. Basic Input and Output Operations**

Input and output operations allow interaction between the user and the program.

- **Input:**  
    input() function is used to accept input from the user.  
    Input is treated as a string by default and may require type conversion.
- **Output:**  
    print() function is used to display output.  
    Formatted output can be achieved using commas or formatted strings.

**Conclusion**

Thus, the Python programming environment, execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations were studied and understood.

### ****Programs****

- **\# Comments**

\# This is a single-line comment

\# Program to demonstrate Python interface and comments

"""

This is a multi-line comment (docstring).

Python supports interactive and script modes.

"""

print("Welcome to Python Programming")

print("This program demonstrates comments and execution modes")

- **\# Variable declaration**

student_name = "Snehal"

age = 45

height = 5.3

is_faculty = True

\# Display data types

print("Name:", student_name, "Type:", type(student_name))

print("Age:", age, "Type:", type(age))

print("Height:", height, "Type:", type(height))

print("Faculty Status:", is_faculty, "Type:", type(is_faculty))

- **Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators**

a = 10

b = 5

\# Arithmetic Operators

print("Addition:", a + b)

print("Subtraction:", a - b)

print("Multiplication:", a \* b)

print("Division:", a / b)

\# Relational Operators

print("a > b:", a > b)

print("a == b:", a == b)

\# Logical Operators

print("AND:", a > 5 and b > 2)

print("OR:", a > 20 or b > 2)

print("NOT:", not(a > b))

\# Assignment Operators

c = a

c += b

print("Assignment Result:", c)

\# Bitwise Operators

print("Bitwise AND:", a & b)

print("Bitwise OR:", a | b)

- **Input and display formatted output using input() and print()**

\# Input from user

name = input("Enter your name: ")

marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))

\# Output using formatted print

print("Student Name:", name)

print("Marks Obtained:", marks)

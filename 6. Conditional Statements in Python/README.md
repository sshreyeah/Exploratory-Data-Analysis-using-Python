### **Experiment – 6**


### **Title :**
Conditional Statements in Python


### **Aim :**
To study and implement conditional statements in Python and understand decision-making using various conditional constructs.


### **Objectives :**
To understand the concept of conditional statements

To implement if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements

To use nested conditional statements

To apply conditional statements in real-life programming scenarios


### **Theory on Conditional Statements :**
Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. These statements allow the program to execute specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.

Python uses keywords like if, else, and elif to implement conditional logic. Indentation plays a crucial role in defining the scope of these statements.


### **Types of Conditional Statements :**

if statement

if-else statement

if-elif-else statement

Nested if statement


### **Program 1: Simple if Statement**
num = 10

if num > 0:

print("The number is positive")


### **Program 2: if-else Statement**

num = -5

if num >= 0:

print("The number is positive or zero")

else:

print("The number is negative")


### **Program 3: if-elif-else Statement**

marks = 75

if marks >= 90:

print("Grade: A")

elif marks >= 75:

print("Grade: B")

elif marks >= 50:

print("Grade: C")

else:

print("Grade: Fail")


### **Program 4: Nested if Statement**

num = 15

if num > 0:

if num % 2 == 0:

print("Positive Even number")

else:

print("Positive Odd number")

else:

print("Negative number")


### **Applications of Conditional Statements**
Decision-making in programs

Validating user input

Menu-driven programs

Checking eligibility (age, marks, etc.)

Control flow in real-world applications


### **Conclusion :**
Conditional statements form the backbone of decision-making in Python programs. By using if, if-else, elif, and nested conditions, programs can respond intelligently to different situations, making Python powerful and flexible for real-life applications.
